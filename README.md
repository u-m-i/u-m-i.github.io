**I tried to give my all, snuggling all my basic knowledge.**
**And there are two aclarations that i want to do, the first one is that all was made with only basic code, nothing of Javascript,Less, Sass or any other frameworks, finally the last is, that my focus is on the Backend and Data science, but don't mean that i can't learn the require technologies**
