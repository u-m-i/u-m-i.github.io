Since the age of 16 I've been working from Marketing to Software Development and since the begging I studied and practiced English.

Currently working on Reality Near as Game Developer.

In my experience, I've write down official documentation and communicates for the enterprises I've been working on.

Writing is one of my best skills and lecture comprehension.

Platzi English Academy test passed.

I worked at Selecu as Game Developer.

I just want to have a work where I can tell the use of my brain at 100%
